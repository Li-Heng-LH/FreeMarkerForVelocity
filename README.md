&nbsp;

### Some Learning Notes ###
##### What is Apache Velocity #####
* "If you're new to Velocity, you can read the Overview to understand its principles.  
Then, you can go through the User Guide for more details. 
* You can check the Velocity Template Language (VTL) reference to write templates,   
and the Developer Guide to guide you in the process of configuring and integrating Velocity. "
&nbsp;


* Velocity is a Java-based **templating engine**. 
* A template engine is a Java **library** to generate text output (HTML web pages, e-mails, configuration files, source code, etc.)
 based on templates and changing data.
&nbsp;

##### Velocity Singleton Model #####
* there is only one instance of the Velocity engine in the JVM that is shared by all.
* This is very convenient as it allows **localized configuration** and **sharing of resources**, e.g. templates, a logger, properties etc. 
* Velocity.init();
&nbsp;

##### Velocity Separate Instance #####
* separate instance allows you to create, configure and use as many instances of Velocity as you wish in the same JVM. 
* This is useful when you wish to support separate configurations, such as template directories, loggers, etc in the same application.
* VelocityEngine ve = new VelocityEngine(); ve.init();
&nbsp;

##### Important #####
* The Singleton we talking about here is the **Velocity engine instance**.
